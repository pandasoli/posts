## Getting Started
<small>`\\033\[[\d;]+m`</small>
</div>

To print colored text we need to print an ANSI code before text (it's not displayed).  
Each ANSI code has its own effect.

The base form is `\033[m`.  
We put the codes we want between the `[` and the `m` separated by `;`.  

The `\033` is an escape sequence, that represents ESC.  
In most programming languages the ESC escape sequence is `\033`, `\e` or `\x1b`.

We can also repeat code as much as we want, but never separate sequences that need to be together.

## Font Effects
</div>

Some terminals don't support some font effects.  
Make sure yours does.

## 2-bit colors
</div>

We use **30-39** for foreground color,  
and **40-49** for background color.

`0` Black  
`1` Red  
`2` Green  
`3` Brown  
`4` Blue  
`5` Purple  
`6` Cyan  
`7` White  
`9` Default color

You might be wondering why `8` is not here, it is reserved for higher level colors.

These colors are not static since they can be changed by the user in the terminal's settings.

<div align='right'>

## 4-bit colors
</div>

> Bright colors

![Table of 4-bit colors for consoles](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9UVnC.png)
<br/>

Now, we may use **90-97** for a brighter foreground color,  
and the **100-107** for a brighter background.

<br/>
<div align='right'>

## 8-bit colors
</div>

> More possibilities (256)

![Table of 256 possibilities of colors](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KTSQa.png)
<br/>

Now, we can choose a color and use it with the pattern `\e[38;5;<color>m` for foreground,
and `\e[48;5;<color>m` for background.

<br/>
<div align='right'>

## RGB
</div>

> All the colors
<img alt='RGB circle' height='240' align='right' src='https://i.stack.imgur.com/01XJ7.png'/>

To use a RGB color we have the pattern `\e[38;2;<r>;<g>;<b>m` for foreground,
and `\e[48;2;<r>;<g>;<b>m` for background.

<br/>

- `\e[1;38;2;124;58;237m`
  - `1` - Bold
  - `38;2; < 124;58;237 >` - RGB purple text color
- `\033[1;4;31m`
  - `1` - Bold
  - `4` - Underline
  - `31` - Red text color
- `\x1b[1;31mSNES Manager \x1b[23mthe best`
  - `1` - Bold
  - `31` - Red text color
  - `23` - Bold off
